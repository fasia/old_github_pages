Model of a web service and its security requirements are designed using UPPAAL Timed Automata. The model is mutated to create invalid behavior which is used for test generation to reveal faults in the system under test. The approach is supported by a model-based mutation testing tool, μUTA, that automatically generates mutants, selects a collection of suitable mutants for testing and generates test cases from them. We modify a previously defined mutation operator and introduce three new operators for additional mutants. We define criteria for the mutation-selection and demonstrate the approach on a blog web service. Results show that the approach can discover authorization faults that were not detected by traditional methods.","tags":["model-based Testing","mutation testing","web services"],"title":"Vulnerability assessment of web services with model-based mutation testing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" title: PAM Project summary: Practical Applications of Model-based technologies to continuous integration \u0026amp; testing methodologies tags:\n Model-based Testing Model-checking Environment modeling date: \u0026ldquo;2012-01-01\u0026rdquo;  Optional external URL for project (replaces project detail page). external_link: \u0026ldquo;https://megamart2-ecsel.eu/\u0026quot;\nimage: caption: Photo by rawpixel on Unsplash focal_point: Smart\nlinks:\n icon: external-link icon_pack: fab name: Project page url: https://research.abo.fi/en/projects/practical-applications-of-model-based-technologies-to-continuous- url_code: \u0026quot;\u0026rdquo; url_pdf: \u0026quot;\u0026quot; url_slides: \u0026quot;\u0026quot; url_video: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;   ","date":1491004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491004800,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"fasia.github.io/project/example/","publishdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"fasia.github.io/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"Scalable model-based framework for continuous development and runtime validation of complex systems","tags":["Model-based Testing","Runtime Analysis"],"title":"Mega Modeling Project","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.
