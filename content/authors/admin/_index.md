My research interest is on evaluating the quality of web services via automatic test generation. My work includes the following topics:
– Combining model-based testing and mutation testing for evaluating the robustness and vulnerabilities of web services,
– Developing test automation frameworks for generating mutants from models,
– Conducting experiments on model-based test design, test generation and test execution for web services.

My minor subject in MSs. was business and entrepreneurship, therefore, I have interest in challenging myself to develop, organize and run a business enterprise, with all of its uncertainties. Recently, I am exploring this area as well.
